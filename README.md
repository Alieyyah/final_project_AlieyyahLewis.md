Project Outline
Summary: Since the establishment of stay at home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health symptoms have surfaced.
Setup: Stay at home orders, and the COVID-19 pandemic fosters the development of symptoms of anxiety.
Conflict: The story will begin by describing how our "normal" world was turn upside by defining the number of Americans experiencing mental health symptoms such as anxiety at the beginning of the pandemic compared to the number of Americans experiencing symptoms of stress 6 months into the epidemic.
Resolution: Encourage people to develop self-care routines.

# The Data

The data used for this project comes from the National Health Interview Survey (Household Pulse Survey). The Pulse survey is designed to collect data in two phases to understand how the Coronavirus impacts American citizens' lives. The data explores the impact of the virus from 8 sectors: education, employment, food security, health, housing, social security, spending, and transportation.

The Pulse Survey includes a raw data set and cleaned data tables that summarize the Coronavirus's impact across the eight sectors. For this particular project, I will explore Coronavirus's effects on people's health, particularly their mental health. I will use the data tables that analyze the development of anxiety symptoms during the pandemic to conduct comparative from week one of the data collection from Phase 1 and week 13, which is the first week of phase two.

The objective is to explore the impact of the Coronavirus on an individual's development of anxiety symptoms. The goal is to introduce what life was like pre-pandemic and the development of anxiety symptoms and show how anxiety symptoms have increased over the past six months. The data is disaggregated by various socioeconomic statuses, such as age, gender, race, income level, education, and marital status. I think it would be an exciting story to tell how anxiety symptoms have increased over the past six months with data from week 13. I plan to start with data from week 1, then do a mid-pandemic analysis of week 6 o5 7, and then show how anxiety symptoms have increased in week 13.
As a recommendation, I propose that citizens develop a self-care routine and introduce trauma-informed school models for students.


# Presentation Method
Finally, for the presentation method, I will be using Tableau to create data visualizations. I think Tableau will assist with being creative and ensuring the data is depicting the actual story that the information is intended to tell. Also, Tableau will provide more flexibility with manipulating the data the visualization.
In regards to the overall presentation of the data, I am planning to use Esri Story Maps. I have used story maps in the past for previous projects and courses. Esri story maps will allow me to take the audience on a clear and concise journey to understand the development of anxiety symptoms during the pandemic.
